This is a good library for binding views. It saves time, it makes you write less and more readable code..:)


### App Architecture

I designed this project with MVP approach.

#MODEL 
Our model objects are in there. They were created from MarvelApi Documentation.

#PRESENTER
The presenter is responsible to act as the middle layer between view and model. It retrieves data from the model and returns it formatted to the view.
There are subpackages for each part of responsibility. It is more readable and editable. (base, comics, comicdetail....)
I generally create BasePresenter and BaseView(interface), but it depends on project's design. It helps me about like showing progressbar, errors, or handling general errors,...

#VIEW 
The view, usually implemented by an Activity (it may be a Fragment, a Viewâ€¦ depending on how the app is structured), will contain a reference to the presenter.
This layer controls UI interactions.(showing a text, handling a click)... There should be no usecase there.. It's only for UI.
There are subpackages for each part of responsibility. (base, comics, comicdetail....) Generally, View and Presenter layers look similar hyerarch.
I generally create BaseActivity, BaseFragment,... for handling BaseView's Interaction. it helps me about like showing progressbar, errors, or handling general errors,...

##INTERACTOR 
It manages data traffic. You can think it is middle of presenter and datasource.

##DI
I create modules classes in di package. (submodules are in presenter package for easy to read.)
